Samples of using the BPG image format on Android.

~~To build Android-BPG-client you need Eclipse configured for native development. Here is a good tutorial for this:  https://mhandroid.wordpress.com/2011/01/23/using-eclipse-for-android-cc-development/~~

To build the project you can now use Android Studio, as the project was updated to use Gradle.

For usage, check the code in MainActivity.java, particularly the getDecodedBitmap function.
